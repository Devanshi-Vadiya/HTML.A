        <p>Hey there, This is<i> Devanshi Vadiya.</i>
           I’m a <b>software engineer</b> specializing in full-stack web development.
           <mark>Professional bug wrangler.</mark> If it runs on code, I can probably fix it—or break it in style.

            Outside of coding, you’ll often find me gaming or experimenting with editing.
            I also enjoy rock music.

            I aim to become skilled in my field. Do my best in coding and web dev. I also aspire to be pro in editing.
