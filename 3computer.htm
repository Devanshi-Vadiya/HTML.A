    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>


    <p>
        The story of <b>computers</b> and the <u>internet</u> is one of the most 
        <strong>transformative journeys</strong> in human history. From the 
        earliest counting devices like the <em>abacus</em> to 
        <mark>artificial intelligence</mark> today, technology has shaped 
        the way we <i>work</i>, <i>communicate</i>, and live. This article 
        explores the evolution of computing machines, the rise of the 
        <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, the birth of the 
        <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, and the 
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>-based web that 
        powers our online world.

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as 
        the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage designed the 
        <u>Analytical Engine</u>, often considered the 
        <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>. 
        Ada Lovelace, often called the <em>first programmer</em>, wrote 
        instructions for this machine. In the 20th century, pioneers such as 
        Alan Turing developed ideas that laid the foundation for 
        <mark>modern computing</mark>. A famous formula from physics, 
        E = mc<sup>2</sup>, demonstrated the link between science and 
        computing power. Another simple notation is H<sub>2</sub>O, which 
        shows how <small>subscripts</small> are used to represent chemical 
        compounds.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        Computers evolved in <b>generations</b>. The first generation used 
        <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, which were large and unreliable. The second 
        generation introduced <i>transistors</i>, making machines smaller and 
        faster. The third generation used integrated circuits, while the 
        fourth brought the <strong>microprocessor</strong>. Today, we are in 
        the fifth generation, where <em>artificial intelligence</em> and 
        <em>machine learning</em> dominate. Throughout these generations, the 
        <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> remained the 
        <u>core brain</u> of the computer. Mathematicians often use formulas 
        such as a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> to represent 
        problem-solving approaches in computer algorithms.

    <h2>The Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> and the internet grew out 
        of research networks like <b>ARPANET</b>. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee 
        proposed the concept of the web, based on 
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. As he once said:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
        Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."  
        – <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Early internet users relied on <del>dial-up connections</del> 
        <ins>broadband and fiber optics</ins> to access data. Over time, the 
        <strong>internet</strong> became a <u>global network</u>, allowing 
        <em>billions of people</em> to communicate instantly. The impact has 
        been described by experts as nothing short of a 
        <mark>technological revolution</mark>.

    <h2>The Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        In today’s era, computers are not limited to large rooms. They now 
        fit in our <small>pockets as smartphones</small>. We use cloud 
        computing, artificial intelligence, and <b>machine learning</b> in 
        everyday life. People type on keyboards using shortcuts like 
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy and 
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste. When executed, the system 
        might respond with: <samp>Text copied to clipboard</samp>. 
        Variables in programming, such as <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, are 
        essential for writing mathematical logic. Technology continues to 
        change rapidly, and what we consider advanced today may soon be 
        <del>obsolete</del> <ins>replaced by something better</ins>.

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>
        To display text on a webpage, one can use the following simple HTML 
        code:
    </p>

    <pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        This demonstrates how <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 
        structures content. Programmers often write pseudocode using variables 
        like <var>total</var> or <var>sum</var> to represent values. The 
        combination of <strong>syntax</strong> and <em>logic</em> makes 
        programming both powerful and creative.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <p>
        The journey from the <u>abacus</u> to modern 
        <mark>artificial intelligence</mark> is remarkable. Computers and the 
        internet have reshaped our world. As technology evolves, humans must 
        adapt quickly. In the words of <cite>Bill Gates</cite>, 
        <q>The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before.</q>
